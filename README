Centage! is my five cents in defining a good fluid css framework. 
Every framework has its shortcomings – as has Centage! too – 
but it also solves some major issues in existing ones. 

My requirements for a grid system are:
1) It should work acceptably without javascript.
2) It should mimic print grids as accurately as possible.
3) Proportions of columns and gutters should be visually equal at any width.
4) It should add minimum extra markup.
5) No representational markup.
6) Should work on most browsers after IE6. IE6 users can expect trouble anyway.
7) Should have a low learning curve – utilize what you already know about CSS layouts and frameworks.

How to get there:
1) Put all presentational markup into CSS.
2) Use LESS to enable more flexible, powerful and compact CSS.
3) Only use javascript and CSS3 to beautify layout.
4) When possible, use CSS standard naming, like "margin-left".
5) Take full advantage of LESS calculation capabilities to deal with subgrids.

The most important benefits of Centage! are:
1) Easy to setup to whatever column/gutter combination.
2) Nested grids that _preserve gutter width_.
3) Full page area is usable (no obligatory horizontal paddings).
4) Subgrids with differing column count inside a page.
5) Right side of page is aligned despite of subpixel rendering problems of different browsers.
