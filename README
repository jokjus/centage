What is this?
-------------
Centage! is my five cents in defining a good fluid css framework. 
Every framework has its shortcomings – as has Centage! too – 
but it also solves some major issues in existing ones. 

The most important benefits of Centage! are:
1) Easy to setup to whatever column/gutter combination.
2) Nested grids that _preserve gutter width_.
3) Full page area is usable (no obligatory horizontal paddings).
4) Subgrids with differing column count inside a page.
5) Right side of page is aligned despite of subpixel rendering problems of different browsers.
